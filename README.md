# WebScrapping-Liga-Futbol-Chile

Rroject under development. So far I have an extraction from the as.com website which consists of a lot of information by player (goals, assists, passes completed, etc). The information is stored in a dataframes dictionary where the key is the name of the statistic and the value would be the data table.

I am looking to do the same by teams and then visualize the information to see if I find something interesting
